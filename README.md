# QLite

A little library to operate DOM like jQuery, as a subset of jQuery.

## Why

- jQuery is thriftless as its size and several less used functions.
- Zepto updates slowly, and leaves [unsolved issues](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/issues).
- Focus one thing, keey a tiny core to operate DOM, without collection operation, animation, network and something else. 
> For example, I hope to separate Ajax to use [fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch)/[axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) instead.
